# Alt Pong

Creating a two player pong game that uses alternative controls to a knob or keyboard/mouse.

Base pong code is remixed from the two player pong sketch by "ARatherLongUsername" on p5.js.

Uses p5-serialcontrol/p5.serialport library to pass analog inputs from controllers on a SparkFun RedBoard to the websocket for p5.js.
